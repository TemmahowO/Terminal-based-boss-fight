## Variables below are for ASCII art and small pieces of the program that wouldn't really make sense to be added into the main file (take for example the variable options) ##
## You can add in your own ASCII art (or unicode art) by making a variable - Example: "logo =" - and then add 6 double quatations ## 
## and in the middle of the 3 quatation marks paste the ASCII/Unicode art ##
